Automated access to [Compute clouds](https://jetstream-cloud.org) to process a T1-weighted anatomical image using [Freesurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) and segment into multiple tissue types and brain regions. This service allows uploading a T1-weighted image and generates the following derivaties:

* Subcortical regions segmentation
* Cortical surface reconstruction
* Cortical mantle parcellation
* Cortical thickness estimation
* Skull stripping
* White matter volume identification
