Automated access to [Compute clouds](https://jetstream-cloud.org) to build large-scale brain networks using the Linear Fascicle Evaluation method [LiFE](http://francopestilli.github.io/life/). This service allows to:

* Build brain network matrices
* Extract anatomical and brain tissue properties connectome edges
