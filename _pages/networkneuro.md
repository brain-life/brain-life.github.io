Structural network construction loses information at each step.

To capture all information available, Networkneuro service will evaluate your tractograph against diffusion signal, and fascicles are encoded into the network.

* Lossless network construction
* Evaluation of the full edge anatomy
* Preserved anatomy reconstruction of edges
* Possible post-hoc analyses of edge traints augmenting tradition network analysies
* Highly distinguishable between subjects and tracking parameters
* Highly reliable cnnectomes within subjects
