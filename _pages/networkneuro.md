Structural network construction loses information at each step.

To capture all the information available, the Networkneuro service will validate your tractographs with the diffusion signal and encode generated fascicles into the network. This creates networks that are `lossless`, in that the diffusion signal and anatomy information are preserved.

* Lossless network construction
* Evaluation of the full edge anatomy
* Preserved anatomy reconstruction of edges
* Possible post-hoc analyses of edge traits augmenting tradition network analysies
* Highly distinguishable between subjects and tracking parameters
* Highly reliable connectomes within subjects
