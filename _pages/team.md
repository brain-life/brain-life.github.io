Sandra earned her Bachelor’s degree in Neurolinguistics, Master’s degree in Clinical Neuropsychology, and PhD degree in Cognitive and Perceptual Neuroscience from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. During her doctoral studies she focused on white matter microstructure alterations in patients with vision impairment using diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI). In 2017, Sandra joined Harvard Medical School as a postdoctoral fellow where she focused on brain networks using graph theoretical analysis combined with dMRI in neurological disorders affecting other sensory domains, such as speech and movement. Sandra is currently examining whether brain changes in glaucoma can be explained solely on the basis of decreased visual input or whether they are part of the clinical manifestation of the disease.
