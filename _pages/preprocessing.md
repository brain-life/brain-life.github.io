Automated access to [Compute clouds](https://jetstream-cloud.org) to process your diffusion data. This service will preprocess your uploaded data and generate a series of derivatives by performing alignment, motion compensation, eddy current correction and extract basic microstructural parameters of the white matter tissue. Please see [here](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft/wiki/DWI-Files) for other additional detials about the methods used for preprocessing your data.
