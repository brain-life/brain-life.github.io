Automated access to [Compute clouds](https://jetstream-cloud.org) to process your diffusion data. This service will preprocess your uploaded data and generate a series of derivatives:

* Fractional Anisotropy <img src="/images/preprocessing/fa.jpg" width="80px;">
* Mean Diffusivity <img src="/images/preprocessing/md.jpg" width="80px;">
* Principal Diffusion Direction (<img src="/images/preprocessing/vector.jpg" width="80px">)

Please see [here](https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft/wiki/DWI-Files) for other additional detials about the methods used for preprocessing your data.
