Automated access to [Compute clouds](https://jetstream-cloud.org) to use the Linear Fascicle Evaluation method [LiFE](http://francopestilli.github.io/life/) to provide quantitative estimates of <strong>Connectomes</strong> quality, given a data set uploaded by the investigator. This service takes as input <code>Diffusion-weighted MRI data (dMRI)</code> and <code>T1-weighted anatomical data</code> and returns as output a full brain <strong>Connectomes</strong> mapped with modern tractography methods. We also provide a quantitative comparison to reference datasets to inform the investigator about quality of the expected results that can be achived with the uploaded data. We compare the results to those obtained on a few sample subjects from the <strong>Human Connectomes Project</strong>, Stanford University data.
