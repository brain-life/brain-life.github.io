## Promoting neuroscience engagement in big-data, reproducible research

We are developing an open, online platform to provide a seamless access to **cloud computing** infrastructure and **brain data** and **data derivatives**. This platform is meant to reach out beyond neuroscience, allowing also computer scientists, statisticians and engineers interested in brain data to use the data to develop and publish their methods.

<!--
Neuroscience is engaging at the forefront of science by dissolving disciplinary boundaries and promoting transdisciplinary research. This process can, in principle, facilitate discovery by convergent efforts from theoretical, experimental and cognitive neuroscience, as well as computer science and engineering. To assure the success of this process, the current lack of established mechanisms to promote open sharing data, software and scientific results must be overcome. Promoting open software and data sharing has become paramount to addressing the problem of scientific reproducibility. **Brainlife** addresses challenges to neuroscience open sharing and reproducibility by providing integrative mechanisms for publishing data, and algorithms while embedding them with computing resources to impact multiple scientific communities. **Brainlife** is a project under active development.
